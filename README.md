```
TO USE : Python Injection.py "PATH TO DIRECTORY WITH YOUR MOKURO HTMLS HERE"
Now supports Mobile Phones,PCs,Tablets! enjoy reading your manhwa!!!
i made sure this is perfect and usable
if you use the colab note to just generate htmls to read and just download the
files using swayomi or tachiyomi or mihon this script got you covered!!
now it looks for the names of the files regardless of extension!
adapts to any screen resolution you throw at it!
with this i will stop updating this as it's already perfect.
